Based \nupon an exhaustive examination into electrochemical attributes, thermal behavior, life cycle management as-\npects along with current trends within markets allow us to create a framework against which these most popular \nelectricity storage alternatives might be assessed. Our results show LFP batteries are safer with life cycles beyond \n2000 cycles at approximately 30 % lower costs than other similar battery technologies. They have enhanced heat \nresistance with the ability to operate effectively up to 60 •C besides having significantly reduced carbon foot-\nprints. On the other hand, NMC batteries have high energy densities, reaching 260 Wh/kg making them suitable \nfor portable electronics and electric vehicles with a lot of power requirements although their costs are higher and \nthere are environmental concerns associated with their cobalt and nickel content. The work confirms that LFP \nbatteries are increasingly being adopted in markets due to cost advantages and safety improvements. We \nrecognize the continued importance of NMC batteries in high performance areas due to their superior energy \noutput ratings. LFP is recommended for applications requiring long lifetimes while NMC is ideal when high \npower is needed. The study indicates the need for better battery technology development towards improved \nefficiency and safety.\nIntroduction\nAs intermittent renewable sources including solar and wind are \nincreasingly relied upon by the world, energy storage becomes impor -\ntant in balancing electricity supply and demand [102] . Furthermore, \nefficient methods of storing energy are important for improved grid \nreliability and efficiency [61]. With regard to capacity, scalability, ef-\nficiency, cost and applicability pumped hydroelectric storage (PHS), \nbattery energy storage systems (BESS), thermal energy storages (TES), \nflywheel ESS, compressed air energy storage (CAES), hydrogen storages, \nsuper capacitors, mechanical storage are some of the options that exist \ntoday. These technologies provide backup power for grid stability in \naddition to integrating renewable sources like solar and wind into \nelectric grids [126] . However, this does not mean that BESS power can \nbe scaled down all the way to small gadgets or up for large-scale BESS \nprojects due to a huge amount of stored energy at initial CAES compared with PHS.\nUnlike pumped hydro storage which relies on specific geographical \nfeatures only batteries have flexible land uses and climate conditions. \nFor example, they can be used in rural areas where there may not be \nhigh mountains to construct dams or very large lakes near them. Large- \nscale lithium-ion battery projects such as the Moss Landing Battery \nproject in the United States demonstrate how batteries ’ capacities can be \nharnessed in order to meet different types of electricity needs [73].\nThey become a focal point or part of broader initiatives aimed at \nreducing fossil fuel dependence, hence realizing environmental objec -\ntives. In today ’s LFP battery markets graphite helps make Nickel Man-\nganese Cobalt better known among lithium-ion batteries users due to \ncertain reasons such as advanced battery technology causing maturity \nTable 1.\n*Corresponding authors.\nE-mail addresses: solomon.evro@und.edu (S.

The dataset \nutilised in this study include macroeconomic time series data from Indonesia spanning the years 2015-2021, as well as issuers indexed under \nthe SRI-KEHATI framework. The data underwent analysis using the multiple regression approach. The study employed an associative research \ntechnique and utilised the Eviews 10 programme tool for data analysis. The findings of the study demonstrate a noteworthy positive impact of \neconomic growth on the composition of renewable energy sources. The impact of population growth on the composition of renewable energy \nsources is shown to be insignificant, but foreign investment is observed to have a notable and adverse influence on the renewable energy mix. The \nimpact of foreign investment on the Renewable Energy Mix is found to be both statistically significant and unfavourable. The variable of economic \ngrowth exhibits a noteworthy and favourable impact when moderated by green investment in Sri-Kehati indexed issuers, specifically in relation \nto the composition of renewable energy sources.

Striving for carbon neutrality requires using energy storage technologies and alternative energy sources. This study \ninvestigates Indonesia’s ecological sustainability, focusing on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and air quality index-related smog pollution, \nwith renewable energy adoption, energy storage technology, and environmental innovation as primary influencing factors. The study employed \nthe Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lag (QARDL) method to explore long-term and short-term correlations between the predictors and the \nresultant variables. The study’s findings reveal a significant negative correlation between adopting renewable energy (REA), using renewable \nenergy and energy storage technology (EST) and CO2 emissions across various quantiles in Indonesia. However, globalization was found to have \na positive and significant relationship with CO2 emissions, but this association was only seen at higher quantiles. The long-term analysis revealed \nthat environmental conservation efforts, renewable energy utilization, and environmental taxes could significantly reduce PM2.5 level haze pollution \nin Indonesia. The QARDL method also supports a negative long-term correlation between REA, alternative ALT, and EST, while globalization \nis linked to increased CO2 emissions in Indonesia, exacerbating environmental sustainability concerns.

This has led to modifications in the c ountry's nickel \nsupply chain and exports. However, the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled in  favor of the European Union's claim that the ban \nhindered EU manufacturers' access to nickel ore. Indonesia has appealed the verdict, contributing to trade disagreements bet ween the two \nparties. This study examines the impact of global trade policies on n ational economic growth and security, focusing on Indonesia's nickel \nindustry. It aims to provide insights into approaches that Indonesia can adopt to enhance its nickel industry and defense ca pabilities while \ncomplying with WTO regulations. The research c onducted in Jakarta, Indonesia, in April 2023, employs a comprehensive review of \nexisting literature and grey literature. The collected data underwent content analysis methodologies to present a comprehens ive narrative, \ntables, and figures. Indonesia's nic kel industry plays a critical role in the nation's development and national security due to its significant \nreserves and investments in battery supply chains. However, reconciling domestic interests with global trade commitments, pa rticularly the \nban on ni ckel ore exports, presents challenges. Indonesia can explore strategies such as incentivizing foreign investment and establishing a \nsustainable regulatory framework to foster the growth of its electric vehicle and steel industries. These measures can help position Indonesia \nas a key global hub for refined nickel and lithium -ion batteries while complying with WTO regulations.  \nKeywords: \nNickel; Ban; Indonesia; Defense; WTO; National Security  \n \n1. Introduction  \nIndonesia has implemented a development strategy centered on commodities, particularly nickel, which has made it \nthe leading global producer of this mineral (CSIS, 2021). This strategy is often referred to as \"resource nationalism.\" \nCurrently, Indonesia's nickel production is primarily composed of Class 2 nickel, a low -grade nickel ore commonly \nused in stainless steel manufacturing (Castillo, Blumenthal and Purdy, 2022).  \nIndonesia holds a significant position in the global nickel industry, not only as the largest producer but also as a \ncrucial participant . The nickel industry, including its value chains, is estimated to have a total value added of €43 \nbillion and generates an output of approximately €130 billion (Nickel Institute, 2023). The nickel industry plays a \nsignificant role in Indonesia's developme nt strategy, which focuses on commodities. The government has \nimplemented measures to increase the value of its nickel production and establish a prominent position in the global \nelectric vehicle supply chain.  \nIn 2014, Indonesia effectively enforced a simi lar prohibition on the export of nickel ore to promote the development \nof value -added nickel products for the stainless steel supply chain (Gleason and Sauermilch, 2013; Merwin, 2022). In \n Reinpal FALEFI  & Hikmat Zakky ALMUBARAQ  & Nora LELYANA   \n \n2 \n August 2019, Indonesia announced a ban on the export of unrefined ni ckel ore, which was subsequently \nimplemented in January 2020 to build upon its previous achievements.  \nThe Indonesian government claims that the ban on raw nickel exports has produced positive outcomes, including \nincreased investments in mining and downstre am activities (Gupta, 2022a). The surge in Indonesia's nickel industry \ncan be attributed to China's demand for nickel ore to manufacture NPI, a crucial component in stainless steel \nproduction. In response to Indonesia's export ban, China has expanded its n ickel ore import sources, resulting in a \ndecrease in Indonesia's market share from 100% in 2019 to 27% in 2021 (Home, 2022).  \nThe imposition of the nickel export ban in Indonesia has caused changes in the nation's nickel supply chain and \nexports. Indonesia banned the export of bauxite in December 2022, aiming to replicate its success in enhancing \nnickel processing capabilities after discontinuing the export of unprocessed nickel ore in January 2020 (Nangoy, \n2022). Despite the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on nickel prices, Indonesia's ban on nickel exports is part of \nits development strategy focused on commodities and positioning itself as a major player in the global electric vehicle \nba"

This has led to modifications in the c ountry's nickel \nsupply chain and exports. However, the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled in  favor of the European Union's claim that the ban \nhindered EU manufacturers' access to nickel ore. Indonesia has appealed the verdict, contributing to trade disagreements bet ween the two \nparties. This study examines the impact of global trade policies on n ational economic growth and security, focusing on Indonesia's nickel \nindustry. It aims to provide insights into approaches that Indonesia can adopt to enhance its nickel industry and defense ca pabilities while \ncomplying with WTO regulations. The research c onducted in Jakarta, Indonesia, in April 2023, employs a comprehensive review of \nexisting literature and grey literature. The collected data underwent content analysis methodologies to present a comprehens ive narrative, \ntables, and figures. Indonesia's nic kel industry plays a critical role in the nation's development and national security due to its significant \nreserves and investments in battery supply chains. However, reconciling domestic interests with global trade commitments, pa rticularly the \nban on ni ckel ore exports, presents challenges. Indonesia can explore strategies such as incentivizing foreign investment and establishing a \nsustainable regulatory framework to foster the growth of its electric vehicle and steel industries. These measures can help position Indonesia \nas a key global hub for refined nickel and lithium -ion batteries while complying with WTO regulations.  \nKeywords: \nNickel; Ban; Indonesia; Defense; WTO; National Security  \n \n1. Introduction  \nIndonesia has implemented a development strategy centered on commodities, particularly nickel, which has made it \nthe leading global producer of this mineral (CSIS, 2021). This strategy is often referred to as \"resource nationalism.\" \nCurrently, Indonesia's nickel production is primarily composed of Class 2 nickel, a low -grade nickel ore commonly \nused in stainless steel manufacturing (Castillo, Blumenthal and Purdy, 2022).  \nIndonesia holds a significant position in the global nickel industry, not only as the largest producer but also as a \ncrucial participant . The nickel industry, including its value chains, is estimated to have a total value added of €43 \nbillion and generates an output of approximately €130 billion (Nickel Institute, 2023). The nickel industry plays a \nsignificant role in Indonesia's developme nt strategy, which focuses on commodities. The government has \nimplemented measures to increase the value of its nickel production and establish a prominent position in the global \nelectric vehicle supply chain.  \nIn 2014, Indonesia effectively enforced a simi lar prohibition on the export of nickel ore to promote the development \nof value -added nickel products for the stainless steel supply chain (Gleason and Sauermilch, 2013; Merwin, 2022). In \n Reinpal FALEFI  & Hikmat Zakky ALMUBARAQ  & Nora LELYANA   \n \n2 \n August 2019, Indonesia announced a ban on the export of unrefined ni ckel ore, which was subsequently \nimplemented in January 2020 to build upon its previous achievements.  \nThe Indonesian government claims that the ban on raw nickel exports has produced positive outcomes, including \nincreased investments in mining and downstre am activities (Gupta, 2022a). The surge in Indonesia's nickel industry \ncan be attributed to China's demand for nickel ore to manufacture NPI, a crucial component in stainless steel \nproduction. In response to Indonesia's export ban, China has expanded its n ickel ore import sources, resulting in a \ndecrease in Indonesia's market share from 100% in 2019 to 27% in 2021 (Home, 2022).  \nThe imposition of the nickel export ban in Indonesia has caused changes in the nation's nickel supply chain and \nexports. Indonesia banned the export of bauxite in December 2022, aiming to replicate its success in enhancing \nnickel processing capabilities after discontinuing the export of unprocessed nickel ore in January 2020 (Nangoy, \n2022). Despite the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on nickel prices, Indonesia's ban on nickel exports is part of \nits development strategy focused on commodities and positioning itself as a major player in the global electric vehicle \nba"

This paper discusses the downstream management of nickel mining materials by \ntaking regulations, economic impacts and smelter development issue in one f rame of discussion. Mining \nLaw 4/2009 amended by Mining Law 3/2020 is the base regulation for downstream mining policy in \nIndonesia, including for nickel. Obligation of mineral processing and refining domestically and restrictions \nof nickel exports are two  main issues that have multiple impact in nickel management proce ss. The relative \nincrease of annual nickel production is part of the economic impact of downstream policy.  Export \nrestrictions affect the fluctuation of nickel production volume and have an i mpact on economic relations \nbetween Indonesia and consumer countries, resulting in a lawsuit by European Union against Indonesian \ngovernment. On the other hand, the construction of nickel smelters encourages value of nickel exports, \nabsorption of local lab or and encourage micro economic activities. It takes time to implement smelter \nconstruction in sufficient quantities as mandated in the Regulation.  Projections of market absorption \ncapacity, infrastructure such as electricity facilities , technology and cap ital are mine factors that influence \nits implementation  \nKeywords:  downstream, nickel, regulation, economy, smelter  \n \nAbstrack:  Nikel merupakan salah satu bahan galian tambang penting di Indonesia karena ketersediaan \nsumberdaya dan cadangannya yang signifikan jumlahnya. Makalah ini mendiskusikan tentang hilirisasi \npengelolaan bahan galian nikel dengan meletakkan regulasi, dampak ekonomi dan pembangunan smelter \ndalam satu kesatuan kerangka diskusi secara bersamaan. UU minerba 4/2009 yang diamandemen m elalui \nUU Minerba 3/2020 merupakan dasar kebijakan hilirisasi pertambangan di Indonesia termasuk dasar \nhilirisasi bahan galian nikel, kewajiban melakukan pengolahan dan pemurnian di dalam negeri serta \npembatasan ekspor nikel mentah adalah dua isu utama yan g memberikan dampak pada banyak hal dalam \npengelolaan nikel. Meningkatnya secara relative angka produksi nikel tahunan merupakan bagian dari \ndampak ekonomi kebijakan hilirisasi. Pembatasan ekspor berpengaruh pada fluktuasi volume produksi \nnikel serta berda mpak pada hubungan ekonomi antara Indonesia dengan negara konsumen sehingga lahir \ntuntutan hukum Uni Eropa atas pemerintah Indonesia di WTO. Di sisi lain pembangunan smelter nikel \ndapat mendorong kenaikan nilai ekspor nikel, penyerapan tenaga kerja lokal s erta dapat mendorong \nkegiatan ekonomi pada skala lebih kecil lainnya. Pada pelaksanaanya butuh waktu merealisasikan \npembangunan smelter dalam jumlah yang cukup sebagaimana amanah UU minerba . Proyeksi daya serap \npasar, infrastruktur seperti ketersediaan fas ilitas kelistrikan serta faktor teknologi dan modal adalah kendala \ndan tantangan yang dihadapi untuk merealisasikanya.  \nKata Kunci:  hilirisasi, nikel, regulasi, ekonomi, smelter  \n \nPendahuluan   \nNikel merupakan salah satu material tambang penting  di Indonesia karena \nsumberdaya dan cadangan yang banyak sehingga Indonesia merupakan salah satu \neksportir utama Nikel dunia. Hilirisasi mineral berangkat dari semangat meningkatkan \nnilai tambah produk material tambang dengan cara mengurai kuantitas dan ku alitas \nproduksi material tambang sebelum di ekspor keluar negeri. Dari sudut pandang regulasi \nlahirnya UU minerba 4/2009 dan diamandemen melalui UU minerba 3/2020 adalah upaya \nmeletakkan pijakan hukum untuk hilirisasi mineral. Sebagai dasar hukum turunanny a \ndikeluarkan Peraturan Pemerintah dan Pertauran Menteri ESDM sebagai pijakan teknis \ndi lapangan. Pada kenyataannya  bridging policy yang menyatukan kepentingan mining \n3611  \n sustainability goals  dengan kepetingan hilirisasi di sektor Perindustrian adalah diantar a \ntantangan substansial secara regulasi pada kebijakan hilirisasi mineral (Handika, 2023). \nKebijakan pembatasan ekspor dan hilirisasi nikel yang diimplementasikan Permen \nESDM Nomor 11 Tahun 2019 kurang tepat karena memberikan efek kontraproduktif, \ndalam po rsi tertentu mendat angkan keuntungan yang lebih besar bagi negara lain. Perlu \nkeseimbangan yang menyelaraskan kepentingan pertumbuhan ekonomi di satu sisi serta \nlingkungan dan kesejahteraan  sosial di sisi lainnya dalam pengelolaan nikel di In"

ABSTRACT  The history of nickel mining in Indonesia began in the Verbeek Mountains in Sulawesi in 1901. The finding of nickel and its extraction occurred in the Netherlands, making it the pioneering site for this ore. Also, the substantial rise in the extraction of natural resources like nickel through mining would inevitably profoundly influence forests, which serve as the core of the ecosystem for both flora and fauna. This study aims to determine the consequences of the growing nickel production on Indonesia’s forests and environment. It involves examining the alterations in the forests due to the increased nickel production and evaluating the broader environmental effects. The research method used in this research is a literature review. This technique seeks to analyze, assess, and interpret diverse research findings to examine them within the investigated subject’s framework. The research result of this investigation demonstrates that the escalating nickel production in Indonesia is detrimental to forests and the environment, leading to deforestation, degradation of habitats, and contamination of the air and soil. These alterations present immediate hazards to human well-being, such as respiratory problems and effects on agricultural output. It is crucial to evaluate and improve the methods used for nickel production and adopt sustainable management strategies to reduce the negative impacts on the environment and protect both the ecosystem and human welfare. 1. Introduction There is no doubt that in Indonesia, mining entails the extraction of natural resources for economic growth and societal development. Indonesia, known for its abundant natural resources, engages in this activity. Still, it also significantly impacts changes in terrestrial ecosystems, mainly forests. This raises questions about the history and process of mining development in Indonesia, especially nickel mining. The history of nickel mining in Indonesia began in the Verbeek Mountains in Sulawesi in 1901 (Khoirul 2023). Dutch mineralogists first discovered it, which immediately became the first location where nickel was extracted. This region was called Kolaka Regency to produce the nickel needed for export to other countries. Later, a Canadian mineralogist continued exploration in 1934 and planned to expand mining. This began INCO’s operations in Indonesia, running a nickel mining block in Soroako, near Kolaka (Whitten and Henderson 2012). \nNasution et al. (2024)   Jurnal Sylva Lestari 12(3): 549-576  \n 550 Nickel mining in Indonesia started production in 1941 (McCarthy 2016). However, after Indonesia gained independence in 1945, Van Gorsel (2022) submitted more data, stating that in 1917 nickel ore was first discovered in Sulawesi by an exploration team from the Indonesian Mining Ministry. This nickel ore is used daily as a mixture of metals and non-metallic materials. Nickel mining in Indonesia continues to grow due to attractive mining prospects. In addition, companies continue to explore enormous resources in Sulawesi to find new locations to expand their business. As a result, Indonesian nickel mining can continue to develop into one of the largest nickel reserves in the world. Recently, various smelters have been developed in Indonesian nickel mining. In addition to meeting the needs of nickel exports, several regulations govern it. Nickel production also aims to meet the needs of local industries in various businesses, such as electrical cables, machine parts, and many other products. In this way, the capacity of some large smelters in Indonesia can reach 90 thousand tons per year. Having more than 20 smelters in Indonesia makes this possible to fulfill. Moreover, the number of these smelters will continue to grow. By next year, 30 smelters are expected. This will make Indonesia "

The \nstudy is mainly related to the use of AI technologies and digital \ninnovations with the aim of creating a decision support tool that \ncan operate on a small mobile device and can be accessed \nanywhere and anytime, for admission to the Railway Technical \nSchool, Bangkok, Thailand. The participants in this research are \ndivided into two groups: 1) six experts chosen by means of \npurposive sampling, all of whom are from different higher \neducation institutions and who specialize in information system \ndevelopment, and 2) 65 students interested in studying at the \nRailway Technical School, all of whom were chosen by means of \nvoluntary selection. The participants in both groups are well \nprotected in terms of confidentiality and anonymity; in other \nwords, the identities of the participants were neither indicated \nnor mentioned in the research instruments. The research results \nshow that: 1) The overall efficiency of the AI chatbot platform in \nterms of three aspects (function requirement, functions, and \nusability) were assessed as being at a very high level. 2) \nAccording to the results of decision assessment based on the \naptitudes of AI chatbot platform users, 86.15% of the said users \nmade their decision based on the suggestions of the platform. 3) \nThe satisfaction with regard to the AI chatbot platform is at \nvery high level. According to the above results based on the \nanalysis of the users ’ aptitudes and abilities, it was found that \nthe AI chatbot platform can be used as a tool for educational \nrecommendations in higher education. The platform is also able \nto analyze users ’ questions accurately and precisely in order to \nprovide answers that meet the users ’ needs. \n \nKeywords —artificial intelligence, AI chatbot platform, \neducational recommendations, higher education \nI. INTRODUCTION  \nCurrently, many higher education institutions have begun \nto provide varied forms of knowledge freedom and the \naccesses to knowledge sources while accommodating the leap \nof change in digital technologies and innovations. As a \nconsequence, this has changed education such that it focuses \nmore on the facilitation of learning. In this study the eventual \nresult is the development of a decision support tool operating \non a small portable device that can be accessed anywhere and \nanytime. The aforementioned advantages correspond to \ncurrent education policies that encourage lifelong learning \nand self-learning by making use of learning materials of all kinds, combined with communication technologies and social \nmedia. \nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a set of technologies designed \nand developed to solve problems and one which has been \nwidely applied in various fields. The core of AI is machine \nlearning (ML). This involves the use of a complex set of \nalgorithms and methods for problem management by mean s \nof categorizing, grouping, and predicting the data needed for \ndecision making, planning, and management with the aim of \nencouraging higher efficiency in organizations. A number of \nAI applications are fabricated on the basis of ML [1], and \nhave been applied in order to achieve better results in terms of \nspeech recognition and speech emotions. Moreover, ML has \nbeen used in data analysis and in a variety of expert systems. \nThe artificial intelligence model (AI model) is a kind of \nprogram that analyzes a data set to identify specific patterns \nand then make predictions. The AI model is designed in order \nto simulate human intelligence by means of algorithms, \nwhereas ML is designed to teach machines to operate in such \na way as to increase their work efficiency. Thereby, different \nAI models perform different functions depending on the \nservices and purposes that are specifically desired. This study \nemployed an AI model in the form of a simple random forest \nalgorithm using multiple decision trees so that the platform \ncan arrive at accurate decisions.

    "content": "Battery 2030: Resilient, sustainable, \nand circular\nBattery demand is growing—and so is the need for \nbetter solutions along the value chain.\nThis article is a collaborative effort by McKinsey in cooperation with the Global Battery Alliance and its members. The authors include \nJakob Fleischmann, Mikael Hanicke, Evan Horetsky, Dina Ibrahim, Sören Jautelat, Martin Linder, Patrick Schaufuss, Lukas Torscht, and \nAlexandre van de Rijt.\n\nGlobal demand for batteries is increasing,  \ndriven largely by the imperative to reduce climate \nchange through electrification of mobility and \nthe broader energy transition. Just as analysts \ntend to underestimate the amount of energy \ngenerated from renewable sources, battery demand \nforecasts typically underestimate the market size \nand are regularly corrected upwards. In an earlier \npublication, a joint 2019 report by McKinsey, the \nGlobal Battery Alliance (GBA), and Systemiq, A \nvision for a sustainable battery value chain in 2030 , \nwe projected a market size of 2.6 TWh and yearly \ngrowth of 25 percent by 2030. But a 2022 analysis \nby the McKinsey Battery Insights team projects \nthat the entire lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery chain, \nfrom mining through recycling, could grow by over \n30 percent annually from 2022 to 2030, when it \nwould reach a value of more than $400 billion and a \nmarket size of 4.7 TWh.¹\nAlthough battery growth will confer multiple \nenvironmental and social benefits, many \nchallenges lie ahead. To avoid shortages, battery \nmanufacturers must secure a steady supply of \nboth raw material and equipment. They must also \nchannel their investment to the right areas and \nexecute large-scale industrialization efficiently. And rather than just greenwashing—making \nhalf-hearted efforts to appear environmentally \nfriendly—companies must commit to extensive \ndecarbonization and true sustainability.\nFaced with these imperatives, battery \nmanufacturers should play offense, not defense, \nwhen it comes to green initiatives. This article \ndescribes how the industry can become sustainable, \ncircular, and resilient along the entire value chain \nthrough a combination of collaborative actions, \nstandardized processes and regulations, and \ngreater data transparency. By emphasizing \nsustainability, leading battery players will \ndifferentiate themselves from the competition and \ngenerate value while simultaneously protecting the \nenvironment. The strategies and goals presented \nhere are aligned with both McKinsey’s battery \nsupply chain vision and the GBA’s principles.\nGlobal market outlook for 2030\nGlobal demand for Li-ion batteries is expected to \nsoar over the next decade, with the number of GWh \nrequired increasing from about 700 GWh in 2022 \nto around 4.7 TWh by 2030 (Exhibit 1). Batteries for \nmobility applications, such as electric vehicles (EVs), \n1 These estimates are based on recent data for Li-ion batteries for electric mobility, battery electric storage systems (BESS), and consumer \ngoods.Exhibit 1  \nLi-ion battery demand is expected to grow by about 33 percent annually to\nreach around 4,700 GWh by 2030.Web <year>\n<Title>\nExhibit <x> of <x>\nGlobal Li-ion battery cell demand, GWh, Base case\n1Including passenger cars, commercial vehicles, two-to-three wheelers, oﬀ-highway vehicles, and aviation.\nSource: McKinsey Battery Insights Demand ModelLi-ion battery demand is expected to grow by about 33 percent annually to \nreach around 4,700  GWh by 2030.\nMcKinsey & CompanyBy sector By region\n2022~700\n2025~1,700\n2030~4,700\n2022~700\n2025~1,700\n2030ChinaEuropeUnited StatesRest of world\nMobilityStationary\nstorageConsumer\nelectronics~4,700\n+27%\nper annum~6x\n2 Battery 2030: Resilient, sustainable, and circular\nwill account for the vast bulk of demand in 2030—\nabout 4,300 GWh; an unsurprising trend seeing that \nmobility is growing rapidly. This is largely driven by \nthree major drivers:\n —A regulatory shift toward sustainability, which \nincludes new net-zero targets and guidelines, \nincluding Europe’s “Fit for 55” program, the US \nInflation Reduction Act, the 2035 ban of internal \ncombustion engine (ICE) vehicles in the EU, and \nIndia’s Faster Adoption and Manufacture of \nHybrid and Electric Vehicles Scheme.\n —Greater customer adoption rates and increased \nconsumer demand for greener technologies (up \nto 90 percent of total passenger car sales will \ninvolve EVs in selected countries by 2030).\n —Announcements by 13 of the top 15 OEMs to \nban ICE vehicles and achieve new emission-\nreduction targets.\nBattery energy storage systems (BESS) will have a \nCAGR of 30 percent, and the GWh required to power \nthese applications in 2030 will be comparable to the \nGWh needed for all applications today.China could account for 45 percent of total Li-ion \ndemand in 2025 and 40 percent in 2030—most \nbattery-chain segments are already mature in that \ncountry. Nevertheless, growth is expected to be \nhighest globally in the EU and the United States, \ndriven by recent regulatory changes, as well as a \ngen"

INTRODUCTION  \nIndonesia, as one of the largest archipelagic nations in the world, faces significant environmental \nchallenges, including deforestation, pollution, and climate change  (Gernaat et al., 2021 ; Rakuasa et al., \n2024) . The urgent need for sustainable development has prompted the Indonesian government to \nexplore renewable energy sources as a viable solution for environmental management  (Koubi, 2019;  \nRakuasa et al., 2024) . Renewable energy, which includes solar, wind, hy dro, and biomass, offers a \ncleaner alternative to fossil fuels and plays a crucial role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions  \nThis transition is not only essential for environmental sustainability but also for achieving energy \nsecurity and economic growth  (Adharani et al., 2023) . The legal framework governing the use of \nrenewable energy in Indonesia is critical to facilitating this transition. Various laws an d regulations \nhave been established to promote the development and utilization of renewable energy sources  \n(Qurbani & Rafiqi, 2022) . The Law No. 30 of 2007 on Energy and the Law No. 21 of 2014 on the \nRenewable Energy and Energy Conservation are key legislative instrum ents that outline the \ngovernment's commitment to renewable energy (Rahman et al., 2021) . However, the implementation \n\nRechtsvinding, Vol. 2, 2 (December, 2024): 45-52 46 of 52 \n \nHeinrich Rakuasa, Philia Christi Latue  / Legal Studies on the Use of Renewable Energy in Environmental Management in Indonesia: A \nLiterature Study  of these laws often faces challenges, including bureaucratic inefficiencies, lack of public awareness, and \ninsufficient investment in renewable energy infrastructure.  \nA literature study on the legal aspects of renewable energy use in Indonesia reveals that while \nthere is a gr owing body of research addressing the potential of renewable energy, there is still a gap in \nunderstanding the legal implications and challenges associated with its implementation  (Kriswandaru \n& Lubis, 2024) . Studies have shown that effective legal frameworks are essential for encouraging \ninvestment and innovation in renewable energy technologies (Karim et al., 2020) . Furthermore, the role \nof local regulations and policies in supporting renewable energy initiatives at the regional level is an \narea that requires further exploration.  \nEnvironmental management in Indonesia is intricately linked to the use of renewable energy. The \nintegration of renewable energy sources into environmental management strategies can enhance the \ncountry's ability to address pressing environmental issues, suc h as air and water pollution, \ndeforestation, and biodiversity loss. According to research, transitioning to renewable energy can \nsignificantly reduce the environmental footprint of energy production and consumption (Najicha et al., \n2023) . This shift not only benefits the environment but also contributes to the health and well -being of \ncommunities across the archipelago.  \nThis article aims to provide a comprehensive literature study on the legal studies related to the use \nof renewable energy in environmental management in Indonesia. By examining existing resea rch, the \narticle will identify key le"

Existing chatbots such as Facebook  chat \nbot, WeChat, Natasha from Hike, Operator, etc. were giving reply f rom its local database. But our approach is to focus on the \nlocal  database as well as web database and  also to make system scalable, user-friendly , and highly  interactive. Various techniques \nsuch as machine learning , NLP , pattern matching, data processing algorithms are used in this paper to enhance the performance \nof the system.  \nKeywords:  Pattern Matching, NLP, Machine learning, Response generation.  \n1. INTRODUCTION  \nThe development of the information technology and communication has made artificial intelligent systems more complex. The AI \nsystems are approaching human activities such as taking a dec ision at a particular moment, performing day to day tasks. In an \nartificial intelligent  field, there are some hybrid methods and adaptive methods available which are making systems more complex. \nNot only that but also there is a hybrid combination of natur al language processing and intelligent systems. These systems can learn \nthemselves and renew their knowledge by reading all electronics articles available on the internet. Human as a user can ask t he \nsystems like usually ask another human. These systems ar e often known as internet answering engines. In addition to the internet \nanswering engines, currently , many applications are introduced such as chatter -robot or known as chatbot which is often aimed at \ngiving an automatic  reply or just for entertainment. T his application's work is very simple  because the knowledge is already \nprogrammed in advance. Few of the methods used in this application are pattern -matching, natural language processing, data mining. \nThe chatbot would match the input sentence from the sp eaker or user with that pattern existed in the knowledge base. Each pattern \nis then compared with the knowledge of chatbot. This knowledge has been taken from various sources.  \n2. METHODS AND MATERIALS  \n2.1: Literature Survey: By using Artificial  Intelligence field, we can develo p many applications one of that is mentioned in this \npaper is chat bot for the education system. Though chat but has a variety of fields like marketing, medical, education, banki ng, and \nfinance. We will see related work in  each field. Medical field chat, but is useful for providing free counseling to the patient,  \nsuggesting various medicines , etc. Even without going to the hospital  or visiting the doctor. Kyo -Joong oh & Dong Kun Lee in [1] \nhave proposed a chat bot  psychiatr ic counseling in mental health care service. Emotion recognition is used to implement this chat \n\nHiremath Guruswami et.al; International Journal of Advance Research, Ideas and Innovations in Technology  \n© 2018, www.IJARIIT.com  All Rights Reserved                                                                                                                  Page | 38 bot.

Those that can beclassified as renewable energy are geothermal, hydro, solar, wind, biomass, ocean,fuel cell, and nuclear.\nKeywords : renewable energy, sustainable\n1. PENDAHULUAN\nIndonesia sesungguhnya memiliki\npotensi sumber energi terbarukan dalamjumlah besar. Beberapa diantaranya bisasegera diterapkan di tanah air, seperti:bioethanol sebagai pengganti bensin,biodiesel untuk pengganti solar, tenagapanas bumi, mikrohidro, tenaga surya,tenaga angin, bahkan sampah/limbah punbisa digunakan untuk membangkitkan listrik.Hampir semua sumber energi tersebutsudah dicoba diterapkan dalam skala kecildi tanah air.\nLonjakan harga minyak (BBM) hingga\nUS$ 70/barrel mempengaruhi aktifitasperekonomian di berbagai belahan dunia [1].di Indonesia momentum krisis BBM saat ini(awal 2006) merupakan waktu yang tepatuntuk menata dan menerapkan denganserius berbagai potensi tersebut. Meski saatini sangat sulit untuk melakukan substitusitotal terhadap bahan bakar fosil, namunimplementasi sumber energi terbarukansangat penting untuk segera dimulai. Dibawah ini dibahas secara singkat berbagaisumber energi terbarukan tersebut.\nMengapa energi terbarukan? Energi\nTerbarukan harus segera dikembangkansecara nasional bila tetap tergantunganenergi fosil, ini akan menimbulkan\nsetidaknya tiga ancaman serius yakni:\n(1) Menipisnya cadangan minyak bumi yang\ndiketahui (bila tanpa temuan sumurminyak baru)\n(2) Kenaikan/ketidakstabilan harga akibat\nlaju permintaan yang lebih besar dariproduksi minyak, dan\n(3) Polusi gas rumah kaca (terutama CO\n2)\nakibat pembakaran bahan bakar fosil.\nKadar CO2 saat ini disebut sebagai\nyang tertinggi selama 125,000 tahunbelakangan [2]. Bila ilmuwan masihmemperdebatkan besarnya cadanganminyak yang masih bisa dieksplorasi, efekburuk CO\n2 terhadap pemanasan global telah\ndisepakati hampir oleh semua kalangan. Halini menimbulkan ancaman serius bagikehidupan makhluk hidup di muka bumi.Oleh karena itu, pengembangan danimplementasi bahan bakar terbarukan yangramah lingkungan perlu mendapatkanperhatian serius\n2.

Dalam rangka diversifikasi,penggunaan energi dari non-renewableenergy resources ke renewable energyresources, misalnya:\n1. Menggagas upaya mengganti BBM\ndengan Bio-diesel\n2. Mendorong pembangunan PLT mikro\nhidro di pedesaan\n3. Mengurangi peran pembangkit BBM dan\nmenggantikannya dengan pembangkitnon-BBM.\n2.1.3 Intensifikasi Energi\nUpaya pencarian sumber energi\nbaru agar dapat meningkatkan cadanganenergi guna dimanfaatkan menghasilkantenaga listrik Pembangunan PLT Angindengan lokasi tersebar (2 unit diharapkanselesai 2006, dan 10 unit selesai setelah2006) Pembangunan PLT Hybrid di daerahterpencil\n2.2 Potensi Sumber Energi\nTerbarukan di Indonesia\n2.2.1 Energi Panas BumiSebagai daerah vulkanik, wilayah\nIndonesia sebagian besar kaya akan sumberenergi panas bumi. Jalur gunung berapimembentang di Indonesia dari ujung PulauSumatera sepanjang Pulau Jawa, Bali, NTT,NTB menuju Kepulauan Banda, Halmahera,dan Pulau Sulawesi. Panjang jalur itu lebihdari 7.500 km dengan lebar berkisar 50-200km dengan jumlah gunung api baik yangaktif maupun yang sudah tidak aktifberjumlah 150 buah. Berdasarkan penelitianyang telah dilakukan di sepanjang jalur itu,terdapat  217 daerah prospek panas bumi.\nPotensi energi panas bumi total\nadalah 19.658 MW dengan rincian di PulauJawa 8.100 MW, Pulau Sumatera 4.885MW, dan sisanya tersebar di PulauSulawesi dan kepulauan lainnya. Sumberpanas bumi yang sudah dimanfaatkan saatini adalah 803 MW. Biasanya data energipanas bumi dapat dikelompokkan ke dalamdata energi cadangan dan energi sumber.\nBiaya investasi ada dua macam. Pertama\nbiaya eksplorasi dan pengembangansebesar 500-1.000 dollar AS/kW:\n1. Kedua, biaya pembangkit sebesar 1.500\ndollar/kW (kapasitas 15 MW), 1.200dollar/kW (kapasitas 30 MW), dan 910dollar/kW (kapasitas 55 MW).\n2.

The required primary energy for producing nickel metal, nickel oxide, ferronickel, and nickel\npig iron is 174 GJ /t alloy (174 GJ /t contained Ni), 369 GJ /t alloy (485 GJ /t contained Ni), 110 GJ /t\nalloy (309 GJ /t contained Ni), and 60 GJ /t alloy (598 GJ /t contained Ni), respectively. Furthermore,\nthe associated GHG emissions are 14 tCO 2-eq/t alloy (14 tCO 2-eq/t contained Ni), 30 t CO 2-eq/t alloy\n(40 t CO 2-eq/t contained Ni), 6 t CO 2-eq/t alloy (18 t CO 2-eq/t contained Ni), and 7 t CO 2-eq/t alloy (69 t\nCO 2-eq/t contained Ni). A possible carbon emission reduction can be observed by comparing ore type,\nore grade, and electricity source, as well as allocation strategy. The suggested process model overcomes\nthe limitation of a conventional life cycle assessment study which considers the process as a ‘black box’\nand allows for an identification of further possibilities to implement sustainable nickel production.\nKeywords: nickel; LCA; energy consumption; greenhouse gas emission; material balance; energy balance\n1. Introduction\nNickel is an important alloying element, which is used in the iron and steel industries. More than\nhalf of the produced nickel is consumed in the production of stainless steel [ 1]. As an alloy element,\nthe addition of nickel has positive e \u000bects on the steel’s strength, toughness, and corrosion resistance.\nIn 2019, the world’s leading nickel producing countries were, among others, Indonesia, Philippines,\nRussia, New Caledonia, Australia, Canada, and China [ 2]. With the increasing attention on sustainable\nprocesses, nickel manufactures are nowadays facing the pressures to improve the environmental proﬁle\nof their products [ 1]. On one hand, it means to improve both the mineral and energy e \u000eciencies during\nprocessing and to eliminate waste and emissions into the nature. On the other hand, these concerns,\nin turn, also impose potential demands on the supply chain in which raw materials and energy sources\nwith fewer environmental burdens should be used.\nTo investigate energy utilization and greenhouse gas emission (GHG) of nickel products, a typical\napproach is to use life cycle assessment (LCA) for the analysis. Table 1 summarizes several reported\nLCA studies of nickel production. From Table 1, it can be concluded that the results from conventional\nLCA studies have limitations when comparing the inﬂuence of various nickel products, ores, process\nroutes, system boundaries etc. on the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Firstly,\nthe common utilization of average inventory data neglects the operation variance between plants [ 3,4],\nsuch as the ore type, ore /product grade and operating conditions. Site-speciﬁc inventory datasets are\nseldom used because the required work is both time and resource consuming. Secondly, the concept\nEnergies 2020 ,13, 5664; doi:10.3390 /en13215664 www.mdpi.com /journal /energies\nEnergies 2020 ,13, 5664 2 of 22\nof treating each production stage as a ‘black box’ limits the transparency and thus the possibility to\nidentify and realize product and process optimisations [5].\nOne way to overcome the aforementioned shortcomings of the conventional LCA studies is to\nuse process modelling based on the law of conservation of mass and energy. This approach has\nbeen widely applied in performance analysis of di \u000berent pyrometallurgical processes, such as lime\nproduction in a kiln [ 6], ferronickel smelting in a rotary kiln-electric furnace [ 7], steelmaking in an\nelectric arc furnace [ 8,9], and silicon alloy production in an electric furnace [ 10]. The current study was\ninitially inspired by the work in the “Sourcing Edge” project [ 11]. A process model based on mass and\nenergy conservation was established for the cases studied with the aim of assessing the primary energy\nconsumption and GHG emission of nickel smelting products, as well as identifying the possibility to\nimprove nickel production with lower environmental impact.\nTable 1.

This paper focuses on an export ban that Indonesia placed on nickel ores \nand concentrates initially in 2014 and implemented again in 2020 following a brief lapse in enforcement. \nIndonesia, a leading global source of raw nickel products, sought to strengthen and expand its \ndownstream nickel production capacity partially through the use of the export ban. The downstream \nnickel products that are made in Indonesia feed into critical applications such as stainless steel, used in \nconstruction and industrial purposes, and lithium -ion batteries for electric vehicles. The potential impact \nof the export ban is examined using datasets that illustrate a shift in the composition of Indonesia’s \nexports to higher -value nickel products, increases in downstream production, and more foreign \ninvestment in Indonesia following the ban. Finally, the paper also explores areas where the increases in \ndownstream production capacity and foreign investment intersect with a variety of issues and \nchallenges related to this growth.

Test data are presented for lithium-ion cells and modules utilizing nickel \ncobalt, iron phosphate, and lithium titanate oxide in the electrodes.   Cells with NiCoO 2 \n(nickelate) in the positive electrode have the highest energy density being in the range of \n100-170 Wh/kg.  Cells using iron phosphate in the positive have energy density between \n80-110 Wh/kg and those using lithium titanate oxide in the negative electrode have \nenergy density between 60-70 Wh/kg.  The power densities can vary over a wide range \neven for a given chemistry.   In general, it is possible to design high power batteries (500-\n1000 W/kg at 90% efficiency) for all the chemistries if one is willing to sacrifice energy \ndensity and likely also cycle life.    The data indicate that high power iron phosphate cells \ncan be designed without a significant sacrifice in energy density.  When power densities \ngreater than 2000 W/kg for lithium-ion batteries are claimed, it is for low efficiency \npulses.  For example, for an efficiency of 65%, the 15Ah EIG iron phosphate battery has \na pulse power of 2330 W/kg rather than the 919 value for a 90% efficient pulse.  \nCycle life data were not taken as part of the present study.  However, cell cycle life data \nreported by Altairnano for their cells using lithium titanate oxide in the negative electrode \nindicate cycle life in excess of 5000 cycles for charge and discharge rates of 2C and \ngreater.  It seems likely that the cycle life of both titanate oxide and iron phosphate \nlithium batteries will be satisfactory for vehicle applications.\nThe cost of lithium batteries remains high ($500-1000 /kWh) when purchased in relative \nsmall quantities, but detailed cost modeling of batteries done at Argonne National \nLaboratory for the various chemistries indicate that in high production volume (greater \nthan 100,000 packs per year), the costs to the OEMs of all chemistries can be in the range \nof $250-400/kWh depending on the battery size (kWh energy stored).  The lithium \ntitanate chemistry is projected to have the highest cost, but it also will have the longest \ncycle life.   \nR&D is continuing to increase the energy density of lithium-ion batteries.  Proto-type \ncells presently being developed have energy densities in the range of 250-300 Wh/kg \nusing layered metal oxides/spinels in the positive electrodes.  Higher energy densities \nappear to be likely combining these electrodes with negative electrodes using composites \nof silicon oxides and carbon.  R&D on electrically rechargeable Zinc-air cells is presently \nin progress.  Energy densities in the range of 300-400 Wh/kg, 700-1000 Wh/L appear to \nbe possible using the Zn-air chemistry.  The power capability of the advanced batteries is \nuncertain at the present time.\n"

Existing cathode chemistries such as lithium iron \nphosphate and lithium nickel manganese cobalt batteries continue to fulfil market requirements. \nHowever, with continued research and investment, next-generation lithium-ion batteries are likely to \noccupy a substantial segment of the battery market beyond 2030, bringing significant improvements \nin performance and/or cost.\nIntroduction\nThe cathode used in lithium-ion batteries strongly influences \nthe performance, safety and the cost of the battery. Around \none-half of the costs of a battery cell are accounted for by \nthe cathode materials.1 At the cell level, the performance of \nlithium-ion batteries is currently limited by the capacity of the \ncathode active material, which lags behind that of the anode. \nAs such, there is considerable interest from the automotive \nindustry, and other sectors, to increase the capacity of cathode \nmaterials. \nBattery technology continues to evolve at a fast pace as \nrelative performance of different cathode chemistries \nchanges with research breakthroughs and developments \nin manufacturing techniques. This Insight outlines the \nbenefits, challenges, likely research directions and production \ninnovations of various battery cathode chemistries, with a \nparticular focus on lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide \n(NMC) and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) type cathodes in \nelectric vehicles (EVs). In addition, beyond lithium-ion battery \ntechnologies, which could reach the mass market in the 2030s, \nwill be discussed briefly. \nThe Insight also outlines key global trends in commercial use \nand offers two possible scenarios for the market uptake of new cathode technologies. The cost of raw materials has a \nsignificant influence on the cathode chemistry of choice, with \nrecent spikes in global commodity prices (including lithium) \ncausing a revival in lower-cost chemistries such as LFP. The \nreport also examines the sensitivities of a variety of cathode \nchemistries to changes in raw material prices.\nA glossary of terms is provided at the end of the document, \nand summary of key characteristics of various different \ncathode chemistries are given in Box 1.\nLithium-ion Battery Cathode Chemistries\nKey cathode chemistries used in lithium-ion batteries today \ninclude LFP, NMC, lithium nickel cobalt aluminium oxide \n(NCA), and lithium manganese oxide (LMO). Each cathode \nchemistry offers unique combinations of cost, energy \ndensity, power density and cycle life performance benefits, \nwith these changing regularly in response to technological \ndevelopments and the evolution of supply chains (Box 1).\nCell energy density is a common metric by which commercial \nviability is assessed. It is an important factor to consider in \napplications where size and weight are critical, such as in \nportable devices or EVs. This can be described in two ways: \nspecific energy and volumetric energy density, which are \ndescribed by the following equations: \nImage: SEM cross-sectional image of an NMC cathode (lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide) produced using the IWS dry film process. © Fraunhofer IWS Dresden \n1 Institute for Energy Research (April 2022).

Two typical layered\nnickel-rich ternary cathode materials, NCA and NMC, are commercialized as\nadvanced lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) for electric vehicles (EVs). The technology ofthose batteries has been improving by steadily increasing the nickel content in eachcathode generation. In this study, we consider two types of batteries having acomposite cathode made of Li [Ni\n0.80Co0.1Al0.1]O2, and Li [Ni 0.33Mn0.33Co0.33]O2,\nwhich are the most common cathode materials for LiBs in EVs since 2010 and theirfunctional recycling is performed. The increasing use of nickel in batterytechnologies has resulted in the continuous growth of demand for nickel over\nrecent years. Nickel was added to the list of critical materials by the United States\nGeological Survey (USGS) already in 2021. Unfortunately now, the sustainable supplyof nickel is even at higher risk due to the sanctions-related disruption of suppliesfrom Russia. Therefore, enhancing the circularity of nickel starts to be vital for manyeconomies. Demand for recycled nickel is growing, however, a systematic analysis ofthe sustainability of its recycling is still missing. Therefore, we provide acomprehensive assessment of the sustainability of the global primary andsecondary production of nickel. Using system dynamics modelling integrated\nwith geometallurgy principles and by analyzing the processing routes\n(pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical processes), we quantify the keyenvironmental concerns across the life cycle of primary and secondary nickelrequired for sustainable mobility transition. Energy consumption, water use, andrelated emissions are assessed for all stages of the nickel supply chain, from mining torecycling. Our analysis shows the possibility of reducing the emissions by around4.7 mt for GHG, 6.9 kt for PM2.5, 34.3 t for BC, 2.8 kt for CH\n4, 7.5 kt for CO, 3.3 mt for\nCO 2, 169.9 t for N 2O, 3.8 kt for NOx, 11.8 kt for PM10, 104.8 t for POC, 1.6 mt for SO x,\nand 232.5 t for VOC by engaging in the secondary production of nickel through the\nrecycling of batteries. However, identical growth rate of energy consumption andwater use compared to nickel mass ﬂows means no technical progress has been\nachieved in different stages of the nickel supply chain towards sustainability over theperiod 2010 –2030. Therefore, an improvement in technology is needed to save\nenergy and water in nickel production processes. The results and ﬁndings of this\nstudy contribute to a better understanding of the necessity for improving closed-loop supply chain policies for nickel.\nKEYWORDS\ncritical materials, environmental sustainability, green energy, nickel, dynamics modelling,\ndecarbonization measures, lithium-ion battery recyclingOPEN ACCESS\nEDITED BY\nFabricio Nápoles,\nMichoacana University of San Nicolás deHidalgo, Mexico\nREVIEWED BY\nCornelius Satria Yudha,Sebelas Maret University, IndonesiaQingchun Yang,\nHefei University of Technology, China\n*CORRESPONDENCE\nSaeed Rahimpour Golroudbary,\nSaeed.Rahimpour@aalto. ﬁ\nAndrzej Kraslawski,\nAndrzej.kraslawski@lut. ﬁ\nSPECIALTY SECTION\nThis article was submitted to\nComputational Methods in ChemicalEngineering,a section of the journal\nFrontiers in Chemical Engineering\nRECEIVED 26 June 2022\nACCEPTED 13 December 2022\nPUBLISHED 05 January 2023\nCITATION\nGolroudbary SR, Kraslawski A, Wilson BP\nand Lundström M (2023), Assessment ofenvironmental sustainability of nickelrequired for mobility transition.Front.

The market for rechargeable LIBs is currently dividedinto three main segments: consumer electronics, electromobility (e-mobility) applications and\nstationary batteries. Within these listed segments, e-mobility is essential for achieving the\nclimate targets. E-mobility essentially means much more than driving an Electric Vehicle (EV).E-bikes and e-scooters have gained popularity and they are increasingly materializing in our dailylives. The battery chemistry used in EVs can also be applied in other mobility solutions ( Vezzini,\n2014 ). However, expected lifetime of e-bikes and e-scooters are relatively shorter as compared to xEV\ndue to the high cycle number at high C-rates in a short period of use ( Oeser, 2018 ;Baeva et al., 2019 ).\nEVs are strong contributors to the expanding market of Li-ion cells because an EV battery system\nis much larger in Ah as compared to consumer applications.

As part of its efforts towards establishing the green energy value chain internationally, \nIndonesia has banned  the export of raw nickel since 2020. The export ban is also aimed at adding \nvalue to the nickel supply chain for the sake of nickel mining sustai nability in the country. The \nnickel ore export prohibition  has caused the European Union to file a lawsuit against the \nIndonesian government in violation of the World Trade Organization agreement. Instead of \ndiscussing the dispute, this study will focus on  whether the export ban will impact the business \nperformance of the nickel mining industry. Given that the country is the biggest nickel reserve \non earth, this study aims to accomplish three distinct objectives : to create a thematic map of (1) \nnickel minin g locations in Indonesia by province; (2) mining locations for the top ten nickel \ncompanies and nickel industry hubs in Indonesia; and (3) the business performance of leading \nnickel issuers in the country. Thematic maps are created based on Geographic Info rmation \nSystems (GIS). The results show that nickel reserves are available in seven provinces; two nickel \nindustrial hubs and ten big mining companies operate in these provinces; and these companies \nhave sound business performance following the ore nickel export ban. Our analysis offers a new \nperspective on the effect  of the national nickel policy on the business viability  of selected mining \ncompanies in Indonesia by applying the company’s financial healthiness measurement in GIS.   \n1.  Introduction  \nThere has been a dramatic increase in the demand for nickel in the battery industry, particularly in the \nelectronic vehicles (EVs) sector. As a nation with the biggest nickel reserves and nickel mine production \nin the world, Indonesia is well -positioned to  entice investors into its battery supply chain. According to \nthe data from Statista [1], in 2023, the global nickel reserves reached an estimated value of over 130 \nmillion metric tons. Indonesia accounted for the majority of the total, with the country holding 55 million \nmetric tons. In terms of  nickel mine production, Indonesia contributed approximately 1.8 million metric \ntons in 2023, which indicates that the country holds a significant position as the foremost global producer \nof nickel from mines [2]. Figures 1 and 2 depict the global nickel reserves by country and the global \nnickel mine producers by country, respecti vely.  \nIn an effort to encourage domestic processing of the raw material and boost the country's nickel \nproduction, the Indonesian government strictly prohibited the trade in nickel ore starting in late April \n2022. The government has mandated that nickel un dergo domestic processing before it may be exported. \nThis prohibition was the result of a series of policies imposed between 2009 and 2019  [3,4] , with the \ninitial export restrictions on nickel ore dating back to January 2014  [5]. Although certain conce ntrations \nof nickel ore below 1.7% remained permissible for export from January 2017 "

Traditional solar energy management systems lack adaptive, \nreal-time optimization capabilities to optimise energy output under changing conditions. In response, this \nstudy proposes a novel method for a smart solar energy management (SEM) system called HCISEM -GAN \nthat optimizes operations in real -time by combining Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with Human -\nComputer Interaction (HCI). Environmental factors, including variations in temperature, cloud cover, and \nsunshine, influence solar energy resul ts; the suggested system uses GANs to forecast and model these \nchanges. To aid the system in anticipating changes in performance and adjusting parameters appropriately, \nthe GAN model creates synthetic data that represents these environmental conditions. Be tter user -driven \nsolar energy management is possible with the help of an easy -to-understand HCI framework that lets users \nengage with the system, examine energy projections, and access suggested changes based on simulated \nsituations. The experimental resul ts show that the GAN -based method improves energy output prediction \naccuracy by 20% compared to traditional forecasting models. A substantial improvement in total energy \nefficiency is achieved due to the interactive support system's ability to let users sw iftly adjust to new \ncircumstances. Solar power systems are made more sustainable and user -friendly with this intelligent \nframework, which optimizes energy generation and allows users to make data -based decisions. Thus, a \npotential approach for improved and  responsive solar energy management combines GANs with HCI.  \nKeywords:  Human -Computer Interaction, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), Solar energy \nmanagement, Real -time optimization, Interactive support system.  \n \n1. Introduction  \nProficiency in a foreign language offers numerous advantages and is frequently a \nprerequisite for educational and professional prospects. Insufficient chances to engage in \nspoken English practice can result in individuals meeting textual standards but faci ng \ndifficulties in effectively communicating, as expected in academic or professional settings \n[1]. The evolution of the education business has expanded beyond traditional face -to-face \nclassroom instruction. In online education, many forms, such as Massive  Open Online \nCourses (MOOCs), interactive classrooms, and live classes, have gained popular attention \n[2]. More and more people are interested in educational technologies and how they may \nbe used to teach and learn foreign languages, thanks to the incredib le assistance of \ncomputer technology. Using computers and other multimedia tools to supplement \ntraditional language instruction has recently gained widespread acceptance as a game -\nchanging innovation [3]. Understanding, evaluating, and producing a wide ran ge of human \nexperiences —including enjoyment, immersion, awareness, productivity, learning, and \nbehaviour modification —is the human -computer interaction's (HCI) goal [4]. Many \npioneers in research and academia are working long hours to improve Human -Compute r \nInteraction (HCI) by integrating multimodal information. This encompasses visual, aural, \ntextual, and other forms of input. Multimodal interaction has recently attracted the Volume 01 Issue 01 (January) 2025\n \n \nJournal of Sustainable Renewable Energy Innovations and \nPractices  \nISSN: XXXX -XXXX   \n \n  \n \n17 \n \nattention of academics and corporations, mostly due to their respective contributions [5].  \nUnder the auspices of these devoted experts, Human -Computer Interaction (HCI) studies \ndevelop, test, and refine interactive computing systems to make them more user -friendly \nand satisfying overall [6]. Improving usability, reaction speeds, and user satisfaction may \nbe possible through human -computer communication simulation [7]. When \ncommunicating with robots, one of the most fascinating and enduring challenges in \nhuman-computer interaction (HCI) and HRI is communicating attitudes, intents, and \ngoals through non -verbal cues like eyes, facial expressions, and situational awareness [8]. \nMost of this integration happens on a personal level by sensory fusion, when compute rs \ncomprehend the user's precognitive, implicit needs through bio -s"

Although Block A and Block \nIgeo have the same category, which is of concern are Cd and Pb, the concentrations of these two \nheavy metals are very small. Generally, Cd and Pb react chemically under acidic conditions, whereas \nlateritic soil is an alka line oxide soil. Heavy metals Cr and Mn function freely to control the mobility \nof Fe, Co, Ni. And Fe only controls Co and Ni. While Pb, Zn Cd are included in the low mobility \ngroup or zero contamination. Multidimensional scaling statistics (MDS) for two -dimensional \nmapping in blocks A Mn, Co, Ni, Cr shows active mobility following the soil depth where the \nchemical function of Fe controls the mobility of Mn so that the concentration of Mn increases, three -\ndimensional mapping shows that Cr and Fe function to  control the mobility of Co, Mn,Ni so that the \nconcentration increases. Two -dimensional mapping in Block B, Cr and Mn functions freely to \ncontrol the mobility of Fe, Co, Ni. And Fe only controls Co and Ni. While Pb, Zn Cd are included \nin the low mobility g roup or zero contamination, three -dimensional mapping is known to have active \nconcentrations of Cr and Mn and control the mobility of Ni, Co, Fe.  \n \n1.   Introduction  \nSince 2004, the management of nickel mines in the Motui area has been started using the open pit mining \nmethod. Currently, some of the mines have stopped operating due to the reason that laterite nickel \nreserves are not economical, which is followed by rec lamation. This anthropogenic effect leaves \ntopographical changes which of course will have a disturbance in the physical and chemical properties \nof the lateritic soil. After nickel mining leaves vacant land or post -mining land, there are other \ndisturbances  [1] on the land and soil [2].  \nLaterite soil is a soil residual from ultramafic weathering, which is a type of soil found in tropical \nand subtropical climates [3]. These soils are formed by tropical weathering of ultramafic rocks that show \niron enrichment  [4]. In the post -mining area of laterite nickel, there is waste overburden material which \nis composed of irregular lateritic soil layers and ultramafic outcrops resulting from mining stripping. \nWaste soil layers experience changes in soil geochemical qual ity features, chemical reactions determine M Mustafa 1*, A Maulana 2, U R Irfan2 and A Tonggiroh 2 \nCONSER-2022\nIOP Conf.

Malaysia is among the countries forging\nahead with the Fourth Industrial Revolution. One of the core technologies mentioned is adopting\nartiﬁcial intelligence tools such as chatbots. In the last few years, there has been a growing interest\nin AI-based chatbot adoption in the non-HEI context. However, most higher-education institutions\n(HEIs) are reported not ready to adopt AI-based chatbots as one of the solutions for virtual student\nservices support. The research of chatbot adoption in the HEI context is still new and is a less explored\nand examined topic in the information systems domain. Moreover, most of the existing research\nregarding chatbot adoption in the HEI context focuses more on the beneﬁt of chatbot usage and is\nnot specialised in a student services solution perspective. Furthermore, most of the studies were not\nguided by the information systems (IS) theories. Therefore, this study aims to identify factors that\ninﬂuence the effectiveness of chatbot adoption in the HEI context by adapting the UTAUT2 model\nas the IS theory reference. A survey method was applied using the purposive sampling technique.\nFor 3 months, data were collected online from 302 users of Malaysia’s HEI postgraduate students\nfrom various public and private universities. A two-stage analytical procedure (SEM-ANN) was\nused to validate the research model and assess the presented research hypotheses. This research\nreveals that perceived trust is inﬂuenced by interactivity, design, and ethics. Meanwhile, behavioural\nintention is inﬂuenced by perceived trust, performance expectancy, and habit towards the use of\nchatbot applications in the HEI context. Lastly, the ﬁndings of this study can be helpful to the HEI\nstudent services unit and can be a guide towards productivity and marketing strategy in serving the\nstudents better.\nKeywords: artificial intelligence; chatbot; higher-education institution; customer service; virtual assistance\n1. Introduction\nAI-based chatbots have changed the customer communication landscape and have\nbecome quite a marketing buzzword. Chatbots are chat robots that interact online with\nhumans, simulating people’s interactions with each other [ 1]. In business sectors that have\ncustomer service support, they are used to address thousands of frequently asked questions\n(FAQ) that may be repeated more than one time a day. These conversational agents are\nbringing a new element to a business’s website and to the way their clients communicate\nwith the company. Expectations for the consumer journey are getting higher, and, by\nintroducing a chatbot as a virtual agent in customer service, it is important to maintain an\nupward trend [2].\nSustainability 2022 ,14, 12726. https://doi.org/10.3390/su141912726 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\nSustainability 2022 ,14, 12726 2 of 22\nIn this 21st century, higher-education institutions (HEIs) are going the digital route.\nHowever, what we might not have predicted is its acceleration in the last decade [ 3].\nIn the era of AI, chatbots are being utilised more frequently in HEIs for instructional\nobjectives by offering prompt and individualised services to everyone in the industry,\nincluding institutional staff and students [ 4]. Over the past few years, leading colleges and\nuniversities around the world have adopted AI-based chatbots for their websites for college\ninquiry. Such chatbots will serve as university guides round-the"

However, much work remains in\nthe area of non goal-oriented conversations, despite signiﬁcant growth in research\ninterest over recent years. To advance the state of the art in conversational AI, Ama-\nzon launched the Alexa Prize, a 2.5-million dollar university competition where\nsixteen selected university teams built conversational agents to deliver the best\nsocial conversational experience. Alexa Prize provided the academic community\nwith the unique opportunity to perform research with a live system used by millions\nof users. The subjectivity associated with evaluating conversations is key element\nunderlying the challenge of building non-goal oriented dialogue systems. In this\npaper, we propose a comprehensive evaluation strategy with multiple metrics de-\nsigned to reduce subjectivity by selecting metrics which correlate well with human\njudgement. The proposed metrics provide granular analysis of the conversational\nagents, which is not captured in human ratings. We show that these metrics can\nbe used as a reasonable proxy for human judgment. We provide a mechanism\nto unify the metrics for selecting the top performing agents, which has also been\napplied throughout the Alexa Prize competition. To our knowledge, to date it is the\nlargest setting for evaluating agents with millions of conversations and hundreds\nof thousands of ratings from users. We believe that this work is a step towards an\nautomatic evaluation process for conversational AIs.\n1 Introduction\nConversational interfaces have recently became a focal point in both academia and industry research\nfor several reasons, such as: a) Rise of digital assistants like Amazon Alexa, Cortana and Siri,\nb) Presence of universal chat platforms with socialbots like Facebook Messenger and Google Allo,\nc) Advances in Machine learning and natural language understanding (NLU) systems, and d) Intro-\nduction of NLU services such as Amazon Lex. “Chatbots” are one speciﬁc type of conversational\ninterface with no explicit goal other than engaging the other party in an interesting or enjoyable\nconversation. While modern chatbots have progressed since ELIZA (Weizenbaum, 1966), current\nstate-of-the-art systems are still a long way from being able to have coherent, natural conversations\nwith humans (Levesque, 2017). Alexa Prize was established to advance the state of the art in this\narea and bring current research to a production environment with hundreds of thousands of users.\nOne of the main challenges faced by researchers is the lack of a good mechanism to measure the\nperformance due to lack of explicit objective for open domain conversations. The Turing Test (Turing,\n1950) is a well-known test that can potentially be used for chatbot evaluation. However, we do not\nbelieve that Turing Test is a suitable mechanism to evaluate chatbots for the following reasons:\n\u000fIncomparable elements: Given the amount of knowledge an AI has its disposal, it is not reason-\nable to suggest that a human and AI should generate similar responses. A conversational agent\nmay interact differently from a human, but may still be a good conversationalist.\n\u0003Work done during an internship at Amazon Alexa\nyWork done during an internship at Amazon Alexa\n31st Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2017), Long Beach, CA, USA.\n\u000fIncentive to produce plausible but low-information content responses: If the primary metric is\njust generation of plausible human readable responses, it is easy to opt out of the more challenging\nareas of response generation and dialogue management. It is important to be able to source\ninteresting and relevant content while generating plausible responses.\n\u000fMisaligned objectives: The goal of the judge should be to evaluate the conversational experience,\nnot to attempt to get the AI to reveal itself.\nA well-designed evaluation metric for conversational agents that addresses the above concerns\nwould be useful to researchers in this ﬁeld. Due to the expensive nature of human based evalua-\ntion procedures, researchers have been using automatic machine translation (MT) metrics such as\nBLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) or text summarization metrics such as ROUGE (Papineni et al., 2002)\nto evaluate systems. But as shown by Liu et al. (2016), these metrics do not correlate well with\nhuman expectations. Serban et al. (2015) recently did a survey on available datasets for building and\nevaluating conversational dialogue systems, which illustrated another problem - th"

In the future, the energy sector will become the largest carbon emitter unless\nthe government commits to dissolving barriers to renewable energy expansion. Literature studies indicate fourbarriers to LDC namely socio-cultural, economic, technology, and governance. This research aims to examine the\nbarriers that hinder the implementation of LCD in Indonesia and to analyze which barriers are most signi ﬁcant.\nThis study uses mixed methods. Qualitative and quantitative data were generated during ﬁeldwork in DKI Jakarta,\nBali, West Nusa Tenggara, and Bangka Belitung provinces. The Partial Least Square –Structural Equation\nModeling (PLS-SEM) approach was used to measure the direction and strength of the relationship. The qualitative\napproach is useful for further deepening the provincial context that was not captured from the previous approach.This study indicates that among those four barriers, technological and governance barriers have negative sig-niﬁcant and direct effects on LCD, and governance needs to be treated as the most critical barrier. This study\nemphasizes the importance of collaboration between central and local governments in implementing LCD. Shared\nvision, equal responsibilities, commensurate governance roles, development of ﬁscal instruments, can improve\nthe coherence and continuity of renewable energy development programs and activities.\n1. Introduction\nClimate change is a major concern in both global and national con-\ntexts. International commitment to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emis-\nsions was codi ﬁed in the United Nations Framework Convention on\nClimate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992. Indonesia rati ﬁed the UNFCCC\nthrough Law No. 6 Year 1994. The convention was followed by the Kyoto\nProtocol in 1997, which was adopted ten years later in Indonesia throughLaw No. 17 Year 2004. The law notes that Indonesia can be one of the key\nplayers in overcoming the challenges posed by climate change due to its\nnatural resource potential, including large forests that are vital for carbon\nsequestration.\nIn 2011, Indonesia targeted a 26% reduction in GHG emissions by\n2030 compared to the baseline, as outlined in the Presidential Decree\nNo. 61 Year 2011 on the National Action Plan for GHG Emission\nReduction (known as RAN-GRK). By implementing a participatory\napproach, RAN-GRK requires each province in Indonesia including local\ngovernments and stakeholders to actively contribute to the Local ActionPlan for GHG Emission Reduction (known as RAD-GRK). Then, in 2016,\nIndonesia signed the Paris Agreement and set up a new target on carbon\nreduction. Based on the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), its\ngovernment committed to reducing emissions by 29% (on its own) or\n41% (with international support) from the Business as Usual (BaU)\nscenario by 2030. Indonesia also initiated Low-Carbon Development\n(LCD) planning to integrate climate change mitigation policies into its\nnational development program, as mandated by Article 3.4 of theUNFCCC.\nThe LCD policy has been integrated into the National Medium-\nTerm Development Plan (RPJMN) 2020 –2024 to emphasize commit-\nment to the environment. RPJMN stated that by 2024, the Indonesian\ngovernment aims to reduce GHG emissions by 27.3% compared to the\nbaseline and increase the share of new and renewable energy by\nabout 20%. The Indonesian government has drafted a long-term\nstrategy on low carbon and climate resilience 2050, and with an\nambitious target Indonesian plan to reach net-zero emission by 2060\nor sooner.\n* Corresponding author.\nE-mail addresses: maxensius.tri.sambodo@lipi.go.id ,smaxensius@yahoo.com (M.T.

In response, the government introduced a new regulation \nabout renewable energy tariffs, including tariffs for photovoltaic (PV). However, there remains a \ngap in the academic literature regarding PV power plant feasibility studies under these tariffs. To \naddress this gap, this study investigates the feasibility of a utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) \npower plant in Indonesia, focusing on the newly implemented renewable energy tariffs based on \nIndependent Power Producers (IPPs) and Indonesia ’s state-owned electricity company (PLN) \nperspectives. Five scenarios were developed based on the proposed 26 MW solar power plant on \nNias Island utilizing RETScreen software. The results showed that based on the IPP perspective, \nthe newly implemented renewable energy tariff was inadequate to make the project feasible, \nhowever, an introduction of a 10 USD/t CO2 emission incentive would make the project finan -\ncially viable for IPPs. Therefore, it is recommended to introduce emission incentives as a strategic \napproach to attract investors and stimulate investment in Indonesia ’s PV power plants market, to \naccelerate Indonesia ’s energy transition. Conversely, the results also showed that the project is \nvery profitable for PLN due to the significant cost-savings from the de-dieselization, leading to a \nreduction in the average generation cost for Nias.   \n1.Introduction \nThe world is highly dependent on electricity, with a projected increase in global electricity demand by 5900 –7000 TeraWatt-hours \n(TWh) by 2030. This surge is equivalent to combining the current demand levels in the United States and the European Union [1]. \nEnergy holds a critical role in Indonesia ’s economy, and the sustainable and equitable development of the energy sector is vital for the \ncountry ’s growth [2]. Indonesia has witnessed a 75% increase in electricity consumption from 2010 to 2020, averaging around 7.5% \nannually [3]. To overcome the energy demand with sustainable development, Indonesia has set a target of achieving a 23% renewable \nenergy mix by the end of 2025 [4–6], and aims for net-zero emission in 2060 [7,8]. However, the current realization of Indonesia ’s \n*Corresponding author. \nE-mail address: hendry_timotiyas@sbm-itb.ac.id (H.T.

Recognizing the urgency, the Indonesian government has \nintroduced a new regulation for renewable energy tariffs [10], including for photovoltaic (PV) power plants. \nSolar power plants are essential to human beings [11], not only for the potential to supply electricity but also for their help to \nmitigate CO2 emissions [12–15]. Countries near the equator, benefitting from high solar irradiance, have witnessed rapid expansion in \nvarious types of solar power plants [16–18]. According to the Indonesian Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM), there are \n112,000 GWp of solar energy potential in Indonesia [19], surpassing the country’s existing installed capacity [20]. According to \nKanugrahan’s 2050 net-zero carbon scenario, PV power plants are expected to contribute to 56.95% of the total electricity generation \noutput in Indonesia [21]. Based on those considerations, it is expected that solar energy will play a key part in achieving Indonesia’s \nenergy transition. Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), the state-owned company responsible for electricity supply in Indonesia, has \ncommitted to lead the country’s transition to renewable energy sources [22].

Industri nikel Indonesia \nmemiliki peran penting dalam rantai pasokan global, terutama untuk kebutuhan kendaraan \nlistrik. Namun, dampak ekologis dari industri ini menarik perhatian internasional, terutama dari \norganisasi lingkungan yang menyoroti kerusakan ekosistem yang masif. Menggunakan teori \nkeamanan lingkungan, studi ini berfokus pada evaluasi reformasi kebijakan seperti revisi \nAMDAL dan pengaturan limbah B3, serta dampaknya terhadap keberlanjutan ekosistem dan \nstabilitas sosial. Penelitian ini menemukan bahwa reformasi kebijakan cenderung bersifat reaktif \ndan masih menghadapi hambatan implementasi di lapangan, yang mengurangi efektivitasnya \ndalam menurunkan laju kerusakan lingkungan. Selain itu, penelitian ini menambahkan kontribusi \npada literatur tata kelola lingkungan, dengan mengungkapkan perbedaan antara kebijakan dan \npraktik, terutama di negara berkembang yang menghadapi tantangan dalam mencapai standar \nkeberlanjutan global. Hasil penelitian ini menyarankan bahwa Indonesia memerlukan \npendekatan tata kelola yang lebih kuat dan berkelanjutan untuk menghadapi tuntutan \nkeberlanjutan dari aktor global. \n \nKata kunci: ekosida, keamanan lingkungan, nikel, Indonesia, reformasi kebijakan \n \nABSTRACT \nThis study evaluates the effectiveness of Indonesia’s environmental policy reforms in the nickel \nsector as a response to global criticism regarding ecocidal practices. Indonesia's nickel industry \nplays a crucial role in the global supply chain, especially in meeting the demand for electric \nvehicles. However, the ecological impacts of this industry have drawn international scrutiny, \nparticularly from environmental organisations highlighting extensive ecosystem damage. Using \nenvironmental security theory, this study focuses on evaluating policy reforms, such as the \nrevision of Environmental Impact Assessments (AMDAL) and the regulation of hazardous and \ntoxic waste (B3), as well as their impacts on ecosystem sustainability and social stability. The \nfindings indicate that policy reforms tend to be reactive and face substantial implementation \nchallenges in the field, which limits their effectiveness in reducing environmental degradation. \nAdditionally, this research contributes to the environmental governance literature by highlighting \nthe discrepancy between policy and practice, particularly in developing countries that face \nsignificant challenges in meeting global sustainability standards. The results of this study suggest \nthat Indonesia requires a stronger and more sustainable governance approach to address global \nsustainability demands. \n \nKeywords: ecocide, environmental security, nickel, Indonesia, policy reform  \n \n Farah Rosada & Arie Kusuma Paksi \n \n76 INTRODUCTION \nNickel is a strategic commodity that contributes significantly to Indonesia’s economic \ngrowth.

Kelly1&Qiang Dai1&Michael Wang1\nReceived: 17 April 2019 / Accepted: 13 May 2019 /\n#The Author(s) 2019, corrected Publication, May 2020\nAbstract\nElectric vehicles based on lithium-ion batteries (LIB) have seen rapid growth over the past decade\nas they are viewed as a cleaner alternative to convent ional fossil-fuel burning vehicles, especially\nfor local pollutant (nitrogen oxides [NO x], sulfur oxides [SO x], and particulate matter with\ndiameters less than 2.5 and 10 μm[ P M 2.5and PM 10]) and CO 2emissions. However, LIBs are\nknown to have their own energy and environmenta l challenges. This study focuses on LIBs made\nof lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) , since they currently dominate the United States\n(US) and global automotive markets and will continue to do so into the foreseeable future. The\neffects of globalized production of NMC, especially LiNi 1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2(NMC111), are exam-\nined, considering the potential regional variabil ity at several important stages of production. This\nstudy explores regional effects of a lumina reduction and nickel refining, along with the production\nof NMC cathode, battery cells, and battery management systems. Of primary concern is how\nproduction of these battery materials and comp onents in different parts of the world may impact\nthe battery ’s life cycle pollutant emissi ons and total energy and water consumption. Since energy\nsources for heat and electricity generation are subj ect to great regional variation, we anticipated\nsignificant variability in the energy and emissi ons associated with LIB production. We configured\nArgonne National Laboratory ’s Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in\nTransportation (GREET®) model as the basis f or this study with key input data from several\nworld regions. In particular, the study examin ed LIB production in the US, China, Japan, South\nKorea, and Europe, with details of supply chains and the electrical grid in these regions. Results\nindicate that 27-kWh automotive NMC111 LIBs produced via a European-dominant supply chain\ngenerate 65 kg CO 2e/kWh, while those produced via a Chinese-dominant supply chain generate\n1 0 0k gC O 2e/kWh. Further, there are significant regional differences for local pollutants associ-\nated with LIB, especially SO xemissions related to nickel production. We find that no single\nregional supply chain outperforms all others in ev ery evaluation metric, but the data indicate that\nsupply chains powered by renewable electricity pr ovide the greatest emission reduction potential.\nKeywords Lithium ion battery .Life cycle assessment .Automotive .Supply chainhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s11027-019-09869-2\n*Jarod C.

Efforts to increase their use, stemming from numerous worldwide\ngovernment policies, suggest that this growth will likely continue (Stephens et al. 2018 ). The\nimpetus for this movement is the potential for these vehicles to reduce both local pollutants\nsuch as nitrogen oxides (NO x), sulfur oxides (SO x), and particulate matter with diameters less\nthan 2.5 and 10 μm( P M 2.5and PM 10), which have adverse human health effects, and CO 2,f o r\nwhich many countries have set reduction targets. Despite the potential use-phase energy and\nemission reductions afforded by electric vehicles (EV) reported in literature (Notter et al. 2010 ;\nFaria et al. 2013 ; Hawkins et al. 2013 ; Bauer et al. 2015 ; Elgowainy et al. 2016 ), previous life\ncycle analyses (LCAs) of LIBs have found LIB manufacturing and its pertinent upstream\nprocesses to be associated with substantial energy and environmental impacts (Majeau-Bettez\net al. 2011 ; Ellingsen et al. 2014 ; Kim et al. 2016 ). In addition to energy and air pollutant\nemission effects, LIB manufacturing is associated with water consumption that can have\nimportant regional differences in both its absolute quantity and the relative stress that it\nimposes on a localized water system. Water consumption is highly influenced by regional\nelectricity production profiles (Lee et al. 2018 ).\nWe recently identified two LIB constituents —the active cathode material and aluminum —\ntogether with energy use for cell assembly as key contributors to the cradle-to-gate energy and\nenvironmental impacts of LIBs. Moreover, we found that the LCA results for LIB depend to a\nlarge extent on the battery supply chain. The high energy d"

C ombining the emission curves with\nregionalised battery production announ cements, we present carbon footprint\ndistributions (5\nth,5 0th, and 95thpercentiles) for lithi um-ion batteries with\nnickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC811, 8-1-1 ratio; 59, 74 and 115 kg CO2kWh−1)a n d\nlithium-iron-phosphate (LFP; 54, 62, 69 kg CO2kWh−1) cathodes. Our ﬁndings\nreveal the dominating impact of materi al sourcing over production location,\nwith nickel and lithium identi ﬁed as major contributors to the carbon footprint\nand its variance. This research moves the ﬁeld forward by offering a nuanced\nunderstanding of battery carbon footpr ints, aiding in the design of dec-\narbonisation policies and strategies.\nLithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are a key climate change mitigation\ntechnology, given their role in electrifying the transport sector andenabling the deep integration of renewables\n1. The climate bene ﬁts of\nLIB-enabled products are evident2,3, but the production of battery\nmaterials4–7and the subsequent LIB cell manufacturing8–10contribute\nconsiderably to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions —a problem\nrecognised by stakeholders across the battery ecosystem11–14. Con-\nsequently, policymakers have begun to implement measures toreduce the carbon footprint (CF) of LIBs\n14. These policies are often\nconnected to “green ”industrial policy targets of localising battery\nmaterials sourcing and cell manufacturing15,16. For instance, in 2023,\nthe hallmark European Union (EU) Battery Regulation came intoforce, coupling market access for EU and non-EU battery producersto battery CFs starting in 2028\n11. Accordingly, leading battery pro-\nducers recently announced sharp CF reduction targets12,17. Further-\nmore, the US In ﬂation Reduction Act (IRA) incentivises the\nlocalisation of battery material and cell manufacturing16,18, which in\nturn affects batteries ’CF. Given these policy developments, adetailed understanding of the drivers and uncertainties of the CF of\nLIBs is warranted.\nThere are a multitude of LIB life-cycle assessment (LCA) studies\nfocusing on CF19–21, but they are known to be sensitive to modelling\nassumptions and system boundary choices19,22,23.T h u s ,t h ec o m p a r -\nability of LCA studies is still markedly restricted, and interpreting them\ntypically requires domain knowledge. In addition, there are three\nmajor knowledge gaps that limit our current ability to comprehend(unintended) consequences and inform the speci ﬁc design of pio-\nneering policies, such as the EU Battery Regulation, let alone evaluateand benchmark forthcoming decarbonisation initiatives within thebattery sector.\nFirst, while the CF impact on energy consumption during battery\ncell manufacturing is relatively well-researched, only a small number ofstudies have evaluated the CF of individual battery materials. Fur-thermore, most of these studies have either analysed individual miningsites or presented commodity-aggregated CF estimates, thus failing toprovide a detailed commodity-level picture that includes varianceReceived: 7 May 2024\nAccepted: 15 November 2024\nCheck for updates\n1Energy and Technology Policy Group, ETH Zurich; Clausiusstrasse 37, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.2Materials and Device Engineering Group, ETH Zurich;\nGloriastrasse 35, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.3Institute of Science, Technology and Policy, ETH Zurich; Universitätstrasse 41, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.\n4Chair of Ecological Systems Design, ETH Zurich; Laura-Hezner-Weg 7, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland. e-mail: pleopold@ethz.ch\nNature Communications |        (2024) 15:10301 11234567890():,;\n1234567890():,;\namong mining sites (see Supplementary Note 4 for an extensive lit-\nerature review).

Here, we quantify the\nfuture demand for key battery materials, considering potential electric vehicle ﬂeet and\nbattery chemistry developments as well as second-use and recycling of electric vehiclebatteries. We ﬁnd that in a lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide dominated battery sce-\nnario, demand is estimated to increase by factors of 18 –20 for lithium, 17 –19 for cobalt, 28 –31\nfor nickel, and 15 –20 for most other materials from 2020 to 2050, requiring a drastic\nexpansion of lithium, cobalt, and nickel supply chains and likely additional resource discovery.However, uncertainties are large. Key factors are the development of the electric vehiclesﬂeet and battery capacity requirements per vehicle. If other battery chemistries were used at\nlarge scale, e.g. lithium iron phosphate or novel lithium-sulphur or lithium-air batteries, thedemand for cobalt and nickel would be substantially smaller. Closed-loop recycling plays aminor, but increasingly important role for reducing primary material demand until 2050,however, advances in recycling are necessary to economically recover battery-grade mate-rials from end-of-life batteries. Second-use of electric vehicles batteries further delaysrecycling potentials.https://doi.org/10.1038/s43246-020-00095-x OPEN\n1Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML), Leiden University, 2300 RA Leiden, The Netherlands.2ReCell Center, Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, IL,\nUSA.3These authors contributed equally: Chengjian Xu, Bernhard Steubing.✉email: b.steubing@cml.leidenuniv.nl\nCOMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS |            (2020) 1:99 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s43246-020-00095-x | www.nature.com/commsmat 1\n1234567890():,;\nElectric vehicles (EVs) generally have a reduced climate\nimpact compared to internal combustion engine vehicles1.\nTogether with technological progress and governmental\nsubsidies, this advantage led to a massive increase in the demandfor EVs\n2. The global ﬂeet of light-duty EVs grew from a few\nthousand just a decade ago to 7.5 million vehicles in 20193. Yet,\nthe global average market penetration of EVs is still just around\n1.5% in 2019 and future growth is expected to dwarf past growth\nin absolute numbers3.\nLithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are currently the dominant tech-\nnology for EVs2. Typical automotive LIBs contain lithium (Li),\ncobalt (Co), and nickel (Ni) in the cathode, graphite in the anode,\nas well as aluminum and copper in other cell and pack compo-\nnents. Commonly used LIB cathode chemistries are lithium nickel\ncobalt manganese oxide (NCM), lithium nickel cobalt aluminum\noxide (NCA), or lithium iron phosphate (LFP), although battery\ntechnology is currently evolving fast and new and improved\nchemistries can be expected in the future2,4.\nDue to the fast growth of the EV market, concerns over the\nsustainable supply of battery materials have been voiced. These\ninclude supply risks due to high geopolitical concentrations of\ncobalt5,6and social and environmental impacts associated with\nmining7,8, as well as the availability of cobalt and lithium\nreserves9and the required rapid upscaling of supply chains to\nmeet expected demand5.\nUnderstanding the magnitude of future demand for EV\nbattery raw materials is essential to guide strategic decisions in\npolicy and industry and to assess potential supply risks as well\nas social and environmental impacts. Several studies have\nquanti ﬁed the future demand for EV battery materials for\nspeci ﬁc world regions such as Europe10, the United States11,12,\nand China13,o rf o rs p e c i ﬁc battery materials only14–16.W e i l\net al.9assess the material demand for EV batteries at the global\nlevel and ﬁnd that shortages for key materials, such as Li and\nCo, can be expected. However, their model does not investigate\nthe in ﬂuence of battery chemistry developments (e.g., improved\nNCM chemistries or novel lithium-sulphur (Li-S) and lithium-air batteries (Li-Air)) as well as alternative ﬂeet and different\nrecycling scenarios.\nHere, we go beyond previous studies by developing compre-\nhensive global scenarios for the development of the EV ﬂeet,\nbattery technology (including potentially game changing che-\nmistries such as Li-S and Li-Air) as well as recycling and second-\nuse of EV batteries. We assess the global material demand for\nlight-duty EV batteries for Li, Ni, and Co, as well as for man-\nganese (Mn), aluminum (Al), copper (Cu), graphite, and silicon\n(Si) (for model details, see Supplementary Fig. 1). We also relate\nmaterial demands to current production capacities and known\nreserves and discuss key factors for reducing material require-\nments.

Aggregated life cycle inventories for battery-grade nickel prevent life cycle analysts from easily pinpointing key impact contributors. The presentwork reconstructs inventoriesvia disaggregation of current and emerging processing routes. Improvingprocess granularity demonstrates variability in climate impacts of 74 kgCO\n2eq/kWh for nickel sourcing\nof an NMC-811 cell. Furthermore, the global ecoinvent v.3.9.1 dataset for nickel sulfate could gravelyunderestimate climate impacts by 120 kgCO\n2eq/kg Ni equivalent. Major contributors to climate impacts\nare readily identi ﬁed for six nickel processing pathways, spanning two mineral families –laterite and\nsulﬁde–and three main processing routes –hydrometallurgy, bioleaching and pyrometallurgy. A\npreliminary assessment of all impact categories highlights the need for both improved fate models anddata collection on inventory parts such as tailings management which are often neglected in carbon-focused studies.\nBatteries are an essential part of th e transition to a fossil free energy\nsystem. However, only if coherently planned will the manufacturing\nof battery cells generate minimal climate change impacts. Large-scalecell production impacts can be broadly divided into two main con-tributing categories: energy consumed to manufacture the battery\ncell, and upstream processing pathways embodied in the cellmaterials\n1. Even if few existing battery LCAs source primary data for\ncell production2, the assessment of a perfectly accurate primary\nmodel (i.e. zero uncertainty for e nergy and materials consumption\ndata) will still exhibit high uncertainty due to its background data.For instance, a recent parametric LCA study found that climatechange impacts of raw materials f or a nickel-manganese-cobalt\n(NMC-811) battery cell may q uintuple from 23 to 106 kgCO\n2eq/kWh,\ndepending on the production routes which supplied its materials. For\nlithium-iron-phosphate (LFP), emissions from raw materials couldtriple from 21 to 58 kgCO\n2eq/kWh3.\nFor the aforementioned analysis, r anges of carbon intensities of each\ncell material were compared to availab le life cycle data, wherefrom pro-\nduction routes are often found to be aggregated via weighted averages ofregions or markets\n3. Aggregation renders it dif ﬁcult to discretize the cell ’s\ncarbon footprint as a function of technology and location speci ﬁcp a r a -\nmeters in materials supply chains4. The same conclusion holds true for\nprospective assessments conducted on aggregated datasets, which do notretain the required granularity to model process-level technological\nimprovements.On the other hand, parametrization allows to target key improvements\nin the supply chain of a material which synchronously improves the carbon\nfootprint of the battery cell\n5. A speci ﬁca n dq u a n t i ﬁed contribution analysis\nof underlying material extraction and re ﬁning processes in the supply chain\nof each cell material would allow for the ideal level of granularity in order toreduce inherent uncertainty in current battery cell life cycle inventories(LCIs). The present study proposes a deep dive into one of the materialpillars of an NMC gigafactory supply chain –nickel - in order to better\nunderstand how to conduct such investigation.\nMost recent publications in the ﬁeld of prospective life cycle assessment\n(PLCA) make use of integrated assessment models (IAMs) for backgroundmodelling\n6–12. Since IAMs do not contain detailed scenarios for the evolu-\ntion of metal markets, future scenarios had to be developed. To generate\nfuture scenarios for seven metals (copper, nickel, zinc, lead, iron, aluminum,and manganese), unit processes from the ecoinvent v2.2 database areupdated according to predicted e nergy mix and energy consumption\nincrease from global ore degradation\n13.T h i sw o r kw a sl a t e re x t e n d e dt o\ngenerate future scenarios (for coppe r, nickel, zinc and lead only) which\ninclude futurized electricity mix, project improvements in energy ef ﬁciency\nand model market share development (i n terms of production locations and\nprimary/secondary share)10.

Despite this ur-\ngency, several challenges impede the widespread adoption of renewable energy, including\ndisparities in energy access, inadequate policy implementation, unreliable government\nfinancing mechanisms, and lack of education and awareness, especially due to the current\nincorporation of hydrogen and nuclear energy. To overcome these barriers, a robust policy\nframework is essential, complemented by progressive policy enactment. This study exam-\nines Indonesia’s evolving energy landscape, highlighting key challenges and opportunities\nfor the implementation of renewable energy. The findings emphasize that a comprehensive\nand integrated roadmap is critical to unlocking Indonesia’s renewable energy potential.\nThe roadmap includes strengthening governance, fostering public–private collaborations,\nand securing diverse financing channels, while offering targeted incentives, such as tax\nbreaks and financial benefits. Furthermore, conducting pre-feasibility studies and regional\nassessments for emerging energy sources, like hydrogen and nuclear power, is crucial to\naccurately evaluate potential risks and opportunities. By addressing gaps in regulatory\nframework and enforcing effective policy measures, Indonesia can facilitate public–private\npartnerships, promote technology transfer, and develop skilled workforce as an effort to\ntransition into a sustainable and diversified energy future.\nKeywords: energy transition; government; policy framework; renewable energy; roadmap\n1. Introduction\nIndonesia, as the Southeast Asia country with the largest economy value, is currently\nexperiencing a vibrant domestic market that has powered annual Gross Domestic Product\n(GDP) growth, exceeding 5% since 2021, and is predicted to continually exceed this number.\nThe high figure of Indonesia’s annual GDP growth itself has surpassed the 4.2% cumulative\ngrowth of ASEAN-5 countries, indicating highly intense commodity manufacture and\nproduction processes in Indonesia’s economic landscape [1,2].\nThe subsequent impact of GDP growth has led to an increase in electricity as energy\ndemand, which is seen with a 5.36% increase in energy demand, resulting in an energy\ndemand of 288.44 TWh in 2023 compared to 273.77 TWh in the previous year [ 3]. Further-\nmore, the actual energy demand has eclipsed the projected value of 4.9% annual increase,\nas mentioned in RUPTL (Electricity Supply Business Plan) 2021–2030 [ 4]. Currently, this\nannual demand is mostly fulfilled through coal-fired power plants (CFPPs), natural gas,\nSustainability 2025 ,17, 2216 https://doi.org/10.3390/su17052216\nSustainability 2025 ,17, 2216 2 of 20\nand oil as conventional energy sources, contributing to around 85% share of Indonesia’s\npower plant capacities, with 88.3% of total output [5].\nThe high number of conventional energy sources are directly and mainly attributed\nto the domineering figure of CFPPs, which shows that Indonesia has generated around\n615 million tons in production, constructing around 49.93 GW of CFPPs in 2023 [ 5,6].\nFurthermore, the Indonesian government has initiated a 35,000 MW coal power plant in-\nvestment through a collaboration between Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) and Independent\nPower Producer (IPPs), where PLN was planned to construct 10,681 MW, while private\ncompanies will account for 25,904 MW of coal power plant, indicating a consensus for the\nprogram [7,8].\nHowever, there are ongoing concerns over the harmful environmental effects of con-\nventional energies’ utilization to Indonesia’s landscape. In 2024, the energy sector is the\nsecond largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter, totaling 35% of Indonesia’s total emissions,\nwith annual CO 2emissions having"

It is abstract, invisible, and untouchable.  Without a \ntangible manifestation, home energy usage often goe s unnoticed.

This will produce a trem endous \namount of data that can be analyzed and fed back to  the user—creating a rich space of opportunities fo r HCI \nresearch. This paper outlines common misconceptions  of energy usage in the home, establishes the poten tial of \nfeedback to change energy consumption behavior, and  introduces ten design dimensions of feedback techn ology \nwith which to build and evaluate future systems. \nKeyword \nFeedback \nIntroduction \nThe United States consumes one quarter of the world ’s energy resources, despite accounting for less th an five \npercent of the world’s population (US Department of  Energy, 2002). The residential sector accounts for  21% of the \nnation’s energy use and the average American househ old spends nearly $2,000 on energy bills per year ( US \nDepartment of Energy, 2006). Home energy and person al transport are the top two contributors of the av erage \nAmerican’s CO 2 emissions into the environment (Weber and Matthews , 2007), accounting for over 50% of their \ntotal carbon footprint. To date, the primary method s applied to improving energy efficiency and/or red ucing \nenergy usage been technological and economic (Armel , 2008). For example, the production of hybrid or h ydrogen \nvehicles has been emphasized as a major solution to  CO 2 reduction and oil dependence. However, there is gr owing \nevidence that a human-centered, behavioral  approach should also be pursued to educate, inform , and motivate \nenergy efficient human behaviors.  \nIn a study evaluating the energy consumption of 10 identical Habitat for Humanity all-electric homes o utfitted with \nthe same appliances and equipment, homes were found  to exhibit a large range in energy consumption, wi th the \nmost energy intensive home consuming 2.6 times  more energy than the least (Parker et al., 2008). Indeed, it has \nbeen consistently found that energy use can differ by two to three times in identical homes, occupied by people \nwith similar demographics (Socolow, 1978; Winett et  al., 1979). Such findings reveal how differences i n human \nbehavior can significantly affect energy consumptio n and suggest that intervention strategies to promo te \nsustainable behaviors could result in significant e nergy savings. \nYet, curtailing energy usage in the home is a diffi cult task. The consumption of energy—be it heating fuel or \nelectricity—is unlike most consumable goods. It is abstract, invisible, and untouchable (Fischer, 2008 ). Without a \ntangible manifestation, home energy usage often goe s unnoticed—unlike, for example, the decreasing amo unt of \nmilk in the fridge, the increasing dullness of a ra zor blade, or a gas gauge nearing empty.

However, this \npotential remains largely underexploited. Fossil fuel subsidies \nare a major obstacle to the deployment of renewable energy on \na large scale [1]. Investment in renewable energy is limited \ncompared to some regional peers. For instance, Vietnam \nattracted USD 5.2 billion of investment in renewables in 2018, \nwhile Indonesia drew only USD 0.8 billion [2]. Action 1: Remove subsidies for fossil fuels\nAs long as fossil fuels are subsidised, the playing field will not \nbe level for renewables. Removing subsidies can be politically \nsensitive and difficult, but there are many international cases to \nlearn from [6].\nAction 2: Establish a ministry of renewable \nenergy\nIndonesia could restructure its energy governance system in \nfavour of more renewables. The Directorate General of New \nRenewable Energy and Energy Conservation is the main \ngovernment body responsible for renewables and is part of the \nMinistry of Energy and Mineral Resources (see Figure 1). It has \nfew resources and lacks the decision-making power to manage \nrenewable energy policies effectively. Indonesia could therefore \nestablish a ministry of renewable energy or a similar high-level \ninstitution and allocate more human and financial resources to \nit. Such a structural change in the energy governance system \nwould send a serious signal about Indonesia’s prioritisation of \nrenewable energy and attract more investors [7]. India is a case \nin point, as its creation of such a ministry helped to attract \nsignificant investment and accelerate renewable energy \ndeployment. The ministry can be viewed as a powerful tool to \neffectively govern and implement policies aimed at upscaling \nthe adoption of renewable energy. A small government body \n(e.g. energy ministry department) usually has limited resources, \nweak management capacity and decision-making power to \nsuccessfully manage a growing renewable energy sector.  \nNorwegian Institute of International Affairs (NUPI), Oslo, Norway.\nASEAN Centre for Energy (ACE), Jakarta, Indonesia.\nEmail: rva@nupi.noa\nb Policy Br ief\nIndonesia: How to Boost \nInvestment in Renewable \nEnergyNo. 06 / 2020\nRoman Vakulchuk  *, Hoy-Yen Chan  , Muhammad Rizki Kresnawan  , \nMonika Merdekawati  , Indra Overland  , \nHaakon Fossum Sagbakken  , Beni Suryadi  , \nNuki Agya Utama  , Zulfikar Yurnaidiab b\nb\na ba\nb b\n*Remove subsidies for fossil fuels\nEstablish a ministry of renewable energy\nPrioritise renewables in the regulatory framework\nImprove and streamline grid management\nMobilise domestic banks to support renewable energy\nPrioritise market entry for investors\nIndonesia has set a target of 23% renewables in the energy mix \nby 2025 and 31% by 2050, starting from 7% in 2018 [3,4]. The \nInternational Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates that \nto fully realise its renewable energy potential, Indonesia needs \nUSD 16 billion in investment in renewable energy capacity every \nyear between 2015 and 2030 [3]. At the same time, massive \nscaling-up of renewables could also save USD 16–52 billion \nannually when the mitigated impacts of climate change and air \npollution  are   taken   into   account [3].  Currently,  Indonesia’s \ncapacity for governing renewable energy is limited.

Thus it \nwould benefit from improving its renewable energy governance \n[5].  With this in mind, we propose six actions that could help \nIndonesia accelerate the expansion of renewables and join \nother emerging economies in the global competition to attract \nrenewable energy investmen"

This target is then realized by committing a plan to build 56.4 GW\nadditional power generation until 2028 as stated in the Electricity Supply Business Plan (RUPTL) 2019–2028. However,\nthe deployment of RE power plant seems to be threatened due to untoward pricing policy which is considerably lower\nthan the generation cost of RE-based electricity, resulting in the increase of possibility of future RE projects become\nunfeasible. Using 242 RE projects documented in 2019–2018 RUPTL, this study aims to examine feasibility of future\nprojects under BPP price and identify other factors which could possibly increase project’s viability. The scope of this\nstudy includes several technologies such as wind, solar, hydro, mini hydro, biomass, and biogas. Financial model was\nemployed to estimate Net Present Value (NPV) of the project as feasibility indicator. Data for project’s cost structure and\nﬁnancial assumption is obtained by literature review, survey and focus group discussion (FGD) to RE developers. The\nresult shows that only less than 50 percent of the samples are feasible, accounting for only 43 per cent by number of\nprojects (103 out of 242 projects) and 42 per cent by capacity (2,452 out of 5,888 MW). Hydro power becomes RE\ntechnologies with the highest feasibility followed by biomass. Projects located in Bangka Belitung, Gorontalo, East\nKalimantan, Maluku, and North Sulawesi are all feasible, while of which in main islands particularly Java Island are\nmostly unfeasible due to the lower tariff. In addition to the low feasibility rate, there are several cost components which\nare considered as Indonesia speciﬁc costs such as local content, land acquisition cost, transmission infrastructure cost,\nand regional adjustment for project location which result in higher project’s cost. Finally, it is important for the government\nto formulate a set of incentive policy for alleviating unfeasible RE projects.\nJEL Classiﬁcation: Q42; Q48; O22\nKeywords\nrenewable energy — project feasibility — power plant — Indonesia\n1Institute for Economic and Social Research, Faculty of Economics and Business, Universitas Indonesia (LPEM FEB UI)\nFCorresponding address : Institute for Economic and Social Research (LPEM) Universitas Indonesia Building.

Introduction\nIndonesian energy demand is expected to increase strongly\ndriven by raising economic and social development and the\ngrowing population. Electricity sector holds an important\nrole for socio-economic development in the country. The\ndemand for electricity has grown at an average 7.1 per cent\nper year since the end of 2000s from 134.6 Terra Watts\nhour (TWh) in 2009 to 245 TWh in 20191, almost double in\njust 10 years. Meanwhile, the electriﬁcation rate increased\nrapidly and reached 98.3 per cent in the end of 20182, grown\nmore than 30 per cent from 2010 which is recorded as 67.2\nper cent.\nAs a respond to the constant hike of national’s electric-\nity demand, the Indonesian Government set an ambitious\ntarget to install additional 56.4 Giga Watt (GW) by 2028.\nTherefore, the government is trying to increase the power\nsupply in the country by setting several fast tract programs\n(FTP) to achieve the vigorous target providing 137 GW by\n20253. However, electricity generation in Indonesia is still\n1National Electricity Supply Business Plan ( Rencana Umum Penyedi-\naan Tenaga Listrik Nasional /RUPTL) 2019–2028.\n2The government claimed electriﬁcation rate as 98.81 per cent in\nthe end of 2019. https://databoks.katadata.co.id/datapublish/2020/01/10/\nkonsumsi-listrik-nasional-terus-meningkat.\n3Based on national target stated in National Energy Plan ( Rencanapredominantly by fossil fuels, particularly coal.
